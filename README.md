## Vacation Portal

For this project I use PHP version 8.1.

### Installation

1. Clone this Repository
2. I included the basic database state inside **vacationportal.sql**, but if you want to initialize it for your self you can run on the root of this project:

```
php .\scripts\InitDatabase.php
```

3. I started my local server using XAMPP(Apache and MySQL) and local php server:

```
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
